## ℹ️ About

I created Vendstor back in 2018, when I [(Franz)](https://github.com/franznkemaka) was 15 years old. I just finished learning C# and had so much fun working on the project. I wanted to create something new and useful and I knew someone having a retail store with a lot of difficulties to manage their store, so I spoke with the owner about the advantages of having a modern POS. Finally, I decided to develop something unique for their Business.
After a couple of months, it turned out there won't be able to use the System due to some legal limitations. Over time, I was thinking of building something similar for other businesses. But It was kind of complicated to use a PC since Tablet POS are easier to work with. That's why I decided to develop a completely new system. Unfortunately, the store for which I built this POS never used it.

## ✨ Purpose & Future

To valorize the time, energy and the love I put into it, I decided to open-sourced it and make it available to everyone. You can clone it modify it for your own store or even develop a system with it.

I'm just cleaned the code a little bit. It is now live. I might even have to redesign the Database.

### 🚧 Note

It is very important to note the design pattern of this project before interacting with. It was designed to host a MySQL Client and connect directly to the server which turns out isn't a good practice, as the MySQL database connection info can be de-obfuscated. Please check out the RoadMap at bottom to see what has to be done to remove this anti-pattern.

## 📦 Applications

-   `Vendstor` is the main application, the POS itself

-   `Installer` is a software used to query the backend to install a particular version of the main app. It is used in case of a managed software where it releases are centralized.

-   `MiniInstaller` is a software that installs the `Installer`, this is for fast distribution purpose

-   `Shell` is a CLI installed in the user host machine, it installs Vendstor, uninstalls it, or updates it.

-   `Uninstaller` is a software that orders the `Shell` to remove all Vendstor instances from the host machine.

## 🎉 Getting started

Vendstor is a C# WinForm application that requires the following services in order to work correctly.

-   MySQL Database: to store data
-   FTP Server: to upload user content

### Running Application

1. Clone repository locally

2. Open in Visual Studio

3. Install all required packages

4. Setup the database by following the guide below

5. Setup FTP Server to allow Image upload (follow the guide below)

6. Run the application and it should just work.

### More

The Vendstor windows application can also communicate with a React Native client app. For the moment it is not yet released, on my spare time I will release it as well and explain how to connect both.

## 🗃 Database

You either use a local MySQL Database or a production one. Here is how you can set up the Vendstor Database.

1.  Create a new database called **Vendstor**

2.  Import the SQL file `vendstor.sql` and migrate it to create the different tables and columns

3.  Make sure to modify the **DefaultConnectionString** in https://github.com/vendstor/vendstor/blob/master/Vendstor/Backend/Database/Database.cs

```
replace YOUR_DATABASE_HOST_HERE with your MySql Database Host
replace YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME with your MySql User Username
replace YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD with your MySql User Password
```

## 📸 FTP Server (for image upload)

If you are using a Linux server, then the setup is very easy. Create a new FTP user on your server and grant it a read and write access to a specific folder that you can specify in the constants file before building your application.

If you are on the localhost, consider using Xampp FTP server, then follow the same guide as specified in the Linux Server configuration.
